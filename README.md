# My Dotfiles.

In this repository, you can find all the necessary files for my environment, using MX Linux as my operating system.

## Requirements

In order to use the exact same files, you need to have [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) installed. Once you have zsh installed you also need to have [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug#the-best-way) installed on your OS.

**PS: I will write down all the _upcoming_ requirements in here.**
