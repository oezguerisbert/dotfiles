# My Dotfiles.

In this repository, you can find all the necessary files for my environment, using MX Linux as my operating system.

## Requirements

In order to use the exact same files, you need to have [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Installing-ZSH) installed. Once you have zsh installed you also need to have [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug#the-best-way) installed on your OS.

## Terminal

I'm currently using the Kitty terminal, in oder to use it install it via 
    sudo apt install kitty
Also make sure to install tmux-plugins with tmux:
    sudo apt install tmux -y
    git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.tmux/plugins/tpm 
   
The settings and configurations for the previous terminal(Konsole) are listed under the [.local/share/konsole](/.local/share/konsole) folder in this repository.
